description: In Glinda of Oz, Dorothy and Ozma journey to a remote part of Oz to stop
  a war between the Flatheads and the Skeezers. But the Flatheads and Skeezers have
  a different idea. Soon Ozma and Dorothy are trapped in an amazing crystal-domed
  city on an enchanted island. The watertight city submerges itself under the water
  and only the Wizard and Glinda can save our heroes, but will they make it in time?
